## Hi. I'm Bas.

I build security products at GitHub. I love data. In a previous life, I had fun with [graph algorithms](/pwahstacktc), wrote a PhD thesis on probabilistic data, and built paleolatitude.org (among other things). Sometimes I write my thoughts down here, and sometimes you'll [hear me vent anger on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bas_van_schaik).
