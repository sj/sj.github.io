We have a lovely 1972 Volkwagen T2 campervan with a lot of character. That's a polite way of saying: we break down every now and then. 

That's why I started to collect details of aircooled VW engine specialists. The map should appear below, but you can also <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s5cGWdGU3aw1oSsEvImWknGDvLPEwq8s" target=_blank>view a larger version straight in Google Maps</a>.

I'm particularly interested in contributions for Scotland and parts of North-Western Europe, but really: any suggestions for anywhere in the world are more than welcome!

(If you have the right permissions, you should be able to edit the map <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1s5cGWdGU3aw1oSsEvImWknGDvLPEwq8s" target=_blank>here</a>).
